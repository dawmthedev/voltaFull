## üé® UI/UX Design Philosophy & Style Guide

- **Base Theme:** Modern, gentle sand-tones (e.g., `bg-amber-50`, `border-amber-200`).
- **Contrast & Clarity:**
  - Use pure white or very light gray (`bg-white`, `bg-slate-50`) for content cards/modals on top of the sand-toned background.
  - Ensure sufficient contrast for text (e.g., `text-slate-700` or darker on light backgrounds).
  - Utilize shadows (`shadow-md`, `shadow-lg`) for elevation and separation (e.g., sidebar vs. main content, modals).
- **Typography:** Clean, sans-serif font (Tailwind default is good). Consistent heading hierarchy and text sizes.
- **Spacing:** Generous padding and margins for readability and a less cluttered feel (Tailwind spacing scale).
- **Buttons:** Uniform button styles (primary, secondary, tertiary). Consistent sizing and spacing around buttons.
  - Primary Action: A distinct, solid color (e.g., `bg-blue-600 text-white`).
  - Secondary Action: Outlined or lighter shade (e.g., `border-blue-600 text-blue-600` or `bg-blue-100 text-blue-700`).
- **Forms:** Clearly labeled fields, proper input types, inline validation messages.
- **Responsiveness:** Mobile-first approach. Test across various screen sizes. Tailwind's responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) are key.
- **Icons:** Use a consistent icon set (e.g., Heroicons via Tailwind UI).
- **Minimalism:** If a feature/button isn't essential or doesn't add significant value, question its existence (e.g., "Upload Bill" button was removed).
- **Layout:**
  - **Main Layout:** Left sidebar for navigation, top bar for user profile/notifications (optional), main content area.
  - **Sidebar:** Clear visual separation from content. Icons and text for navigation items. Collapsible on smaller screens.
  - **Tables/Grids:** Clean, readable data presentation. Sufficient padding in cells. Sorting and filtering options. Alternating row colors for readability if needed (`even:bg-amber-50/50`).
